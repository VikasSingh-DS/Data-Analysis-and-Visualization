# Inspiration
A few questions that can be answered using this dataset are: 1. What did India export the most in any given year? 2. Which commodity forms a major chunk of trade? Does it conform to theories of international trade? 3. How has the trade between India and any given country grown over time?

A visualization of this dataset would be a great way to explore more such questions.
