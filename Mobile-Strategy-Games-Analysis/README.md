# Mobile-Strategy-Games--Data-Analysis-and-Visualization
The mobile games industry is worth billions of dollars, with companies spending vast amounts of money on the development and marketing of these games to an equally large market. Using this data set, insights can be gained into a sub-market of this market, strategy games. This sub-market includes titles such as Clash of Clans, Plants vs Zombies and Pokemon GO.

# Background
This is the data of 17007 strategy games on the Apple App Store. It was collected on the 3rd of August 2019, using the iTunes API and the App Store sitemap.

# Ideas
You could use the number of ratings as a proxy indicator for the overall success of a game, and then work out what factors make a successful game. Or you could measure the state of the market over time and try predict where it is headed. And I think an analysis of the icons of the apps would be pretty cool.
